# StamiChat
Just a chat server I made in Python. It's quite easy to run, designed to work on localhost, but you could also make it work on Replit.

## INFORMATION
The code contains a list of banned words, including slurs, and I plan to add more. This list prevents users from using slurs in their messages or usernames. Feel free to add or remove words as you see fit.
